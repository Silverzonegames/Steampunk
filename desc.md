# The Steampunkist

Vengeance dies last. This is more relevant than ever for the main character, Max Mitchell, whose family was treacherously and purposefully destroyed by the overlord and his robotic servants. At least, that's what Max thinks and therefore he starts his journey with one mission, to kill the Overlord.

## Environment
In "The Steampunkist", you must explore different places and using your arsenal of weapons and gadgets defeat the evil robot and its army of machines. On this path, you will meet various people which will either try to help you, ignore you or kill you. You decide how you respond to that.
Your player will visit three different islands with different environments, people and history.
First island allows you to see the views of green coniferous forests, rock mountains and the home village of Max Mitchell. But this beautiful climate should not distract you from the dangers that await you either from the invaders or from island nature. As long as you explore the island, the environment will become less and less green, due to the masters of the southern part of the island.
Second island, however, meets Max with wide deserts and deep canyons. Unfriendly wild west environment is also home to various bandits, communities and savages. Once again, you need to keep an eye on everything, because everywhere would be a danger.
Third island is the one island, where the urban area is bigger than the natural area. There Max Mitchell will finally settle scores with Overlord.
